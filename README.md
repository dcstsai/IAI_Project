### What To Buy: A Recommendation System for Amazon Based on Co-Purchasing Behavior

**I. Team Members**

David Tsai (chishiut), Judy Tsai (weiyit), Lili Chen (lilichen), Yilin Lyu (yilinlyu), Abigail Zhang (tianaiz)

**II. Project Description**

Our goal is to analyze and leverage the co-purchasing behavior of Amazon customers to make product recommendations and uncover patterns and insights related to product associations. This can help find potential sales boost opportunities and improve customerâ€™s shopping experience.

**III. Our Approach**

We divide our groups into two subteams based on the models we use. The GNN team (David, Judy, and Lili) uses the graph neural network (GNN) model and the ML team (Yilin and Abigail) focuses on machine learning models. The two teams then work together to analyze the results.

**IV. Data Sources**

The datasets are available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/

We use the following datasets for this project:
1. Amazon product co-purchasing network
- https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0302.html
- https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0312.html
- https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0505.html
- https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0601.html
2. Amazon product co-purchasing network metadata, including title, salesrank, etc.

All datasets, including the ones we preprocessed, are available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1upHgc2Mli8AeIidkWyZ8vGL46W3P7B8q?usp=sharing
